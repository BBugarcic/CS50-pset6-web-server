## Respect Academic Honesty

"This  course’s  philosophy  on  academic  honesty  is  best  stated  as  "be  reasonable."  The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course’s material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line."
